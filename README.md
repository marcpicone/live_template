My own Live templates

### What's In?

Here you could found my personal live templates used in my day to day work.

It contain the following :

- MarcCodeHelper : Used in kotlin part, 17 predefine piece of code from a simple binding generation to a complete listener creation
- MarcShapeXmlComposeLike : Used in XML part to create drawabl shape -> A little goal here will be to match as much as possible the compose one to build shape with the same naming.
- MarcXmlComposeLike : Used in XML part to build ui. Contain implementation for LinearLayout, ImageView and others -> Same goal here, having a naming convention as close as possible to compose.
